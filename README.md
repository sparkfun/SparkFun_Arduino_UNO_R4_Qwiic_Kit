The SparkFun Arduino UNO R4 WiFi Qwiic Kit is a great way to start with Arduino and the Qwiic-connect system. This kit includes everything you need to build a WiFi-enabled project, including an Arduino UNO R4 board, an assortment of Qwiic-enabled sensors and input boards, a Qwiic OLED Display, and a variety of other components to get you connected. Hooking up a handful of inputs and outputs to an Arduino UNO R4 has never been so easy.

The UNO universe expands with the Arduino UNO R4 WiFi: the same industry-standard form factor at 5V operating voltage, but with the enhanced performance of a RA4M1 32-bit microcontroller by Renesas with ESP32-S3-MINI coprocessor – for increased computational power, memory and speed – as well as WiFi® and Bluetooth® connectivity, a 12 x 8 LED matrix, and a Qwiic connector.

The SparkFun Arduino UNO R4 WiFi Qwiic Kit is a great way to learn about Arduino, WiFi, and electronics. With this kit, you can build your WiFi-enabled projects and connect your devices to the Internet of Things.
